# Summary of software contributions to advancing tools in the Earth System Sciences (Action 4)


This document lists all software contributions to open source solutions for the handling and analysis of large gridded datasets, that have been implemented in the frame of the NFDI4Earth  Measure 2.5. 


## Software Contributions 
General frame of how we chose the packages we contribute to

- python ecosystem already quite developed regarding the data handling
- contribute to R and Julia to enable good research data management in more use cases
    - highlight HPC for julia and statistics community for R
- standardisation across different programming language communities
    therefore participation in zarr-specs and pangeo



The software contributions are listed per package with a short description of the purpose of the packages.

### YAXArrays.jl (Felix)
YAXArrays.jl is an open source Julia library for large-scale computations on larger than memory gridded datasets. It provides access to a variety of file formats like Zarr, NetCDF, GeoTiff and more. 
YAXArrays.jl enables large distributed computations by appyling arbitrary user-defined functions to huge datasets in an efficient way by respecting the underlying chunking structure of the input datasets. 
Automatically supports multi-threaded and distributed computations or a mix of both, depending on the cluster architecture. 
It tries to mimic the data model of the xarray python library, so that dimension names form the basis of merging broadcast operations.
It is a computational framework on top of the DiskArrays.jl package and uses Zarr.jl, NetCDF.jl and GDAL.jl for the access of different data formats.

In the first year of the NFDI4Earth project the 

### zarr-specs

### Pangeo-Europe

### Zarr.jl (Fabian)

### DiskArrays.jl (Fabian)

### DiskArrayEngine.jl (Fabian)

### PyramidScheme.jl (Felix)

PyramidScheme.jl is a Julia package for the computation of image pyramids for larger than memory datasets. It currently works for the computation of two dimensional aggregations with user-defined aggregation functions. 
The image pyramids can then be used for a fast and interactive visualisation of the data.

The PyramidScheme.jl package has been developed in the scope of the NFDI4Earth project and a first working prototype is available as free software at https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/PyramidScheme.jl


### EarthDataLab.jl (Fabian)

### Zarr Reading in R (Edzer)


### Other R packages ?
@edzer if you want to mention other R packages or packages in general feel free to add them here.

## Tutorials and Documentation ??

Should we highlight tutorials and documentation we also contributed to?
Example is the JuliaEO workshop in January
