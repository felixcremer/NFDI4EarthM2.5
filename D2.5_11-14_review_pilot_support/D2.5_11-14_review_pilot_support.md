# Review of pilot support and interaction with the academy


This document captures the support Measure 2.5 Advancing Tools offered for the first round of pilots of the NFDI4Earth project.



## Consulting


Telefonat mit Jonas Eberle über ESDL.jl und unterschiede zu den Pythonlösungen
Vorstellung der Data Cube Idee im ersten Pilotentreffen
Treffen mit interessierten Piloten um näher auf Data Cubes einzugehen und die Vor- und Nachteile und die Anwendungsfälle zu beleuchten


## Development support

Interaction with the pilot study "Statistical Learning to assess factors underlying environmental changes"

Fruitful interactions have evolved with the pilot study "Statistical Learning to assess factors underlying environmental changes". 
They transfered the application of new statistical methods to a data cube framework and approached us with several
support requests. We could solve most of the technical questions the pilot posed to us and contributed to their success
in creating their final product. The following list of github issues was solved in relation to the support of this pilot:

https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/YAXArrays.jl/issues/159
https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/YAXArrays.jl/issues/192
https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/YAXArrays.jl/issues/216
https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/YAXArrays.jl/issues/237

## Interaction with the Academy

To dissiminate the usage of data cube technologies to early career scientist we are currently planning to participate in the Academy hackathon with a data cube use case that will enable the Academy fellows to work with data cube in a confined environment and to get hands-on experience in the handling of data cubes. 
The main focus of this hackathon challenge is to show the usage of data cubes for the data preparation to ease the data analysis with a focus of data reusability.
